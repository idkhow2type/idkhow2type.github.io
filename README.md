# Personal website that I definitely will actually code one day

## About me

I'm a kid that likes scripting and hates algorithms.

## Projects

You are on my github profile, so you can see my projects. I'm not going to list them here. (Go to the [repositories](https://github.com/idkhow2type?tab=repositories))

Having said that, here are some web things I made that are hosted on Github:
- [Spelling practice](https://idkhow2type.github.io/spelling-practice/): An simple but ultra fast tool to help you learn to type hard words properly
- [Color guesser](https://idkhow2type.github.io/color-guesser/): A game where you guess the color of a randomly generated RGB value

## Contact

To contact me, clone this repository and edit the README.md file. Then, make a pull request. I might then review it in as soon as 7 business days. If it's funnier than this page currently is (not a high bar ikr), I'll merge it and reach out to you.
